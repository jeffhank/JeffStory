A large monkey likes to climb trees. One day he climbed a little too high. 
He fell from the tree and hurt himself. He will never climb that high again. One day he was feeling inspired after watching an episode of South Park. He got up out of his chair and climbed out of his chair and climbed all the way to the top but when he got there, he was too high and didn't know how to get down.
Fortunately, he saw some of his monkey friends swinging by on a nearby tree. He howled out for help and thankfully they heard him. They came to him and created a ladder with their bodies by latching togther so that their friend could get down safely.
"What were you thinking?!" his friends exclaimed. "I... I just wanna be like Tarzan" said the monkey. "You'll never be like Tarzan!" laughed his friends. From that day forward, he vowed to become the best monkey in the game, and started hitting the monkey gym every day. He was destined for greatness. After training intensely, he entered a climbing contest. He won first place and proved all of his other monkey friends wrong. He will always be remembered as the best monkey climber.
